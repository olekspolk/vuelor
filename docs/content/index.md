features:
  - title: Lego-like
    details: Instead of one pre-built <ColorPicker /> component, you get smaller building blocks — such as the Canvas, Slider, Input — that can be combined and styled however you like.
  - title: Tailwind-Friendly
    details: If your project uses TailwindCSS, you’ll find that every part of the picker fits naturally into your design system. But you’re never locked in — you can use plain CSS or CSS Modules.
  - title: Accessibility by Design
    details: Accessibility isn’t an afterthought — it’s a foundation. Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and focus management are all built in according to the WAI-ARIA Color Picker Pattern.
