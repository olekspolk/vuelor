# Introduction

Most color pickers out there are either too rigid to customize or too complex to integrate into modern **Tailwind-based** projects. This library was built to fill that gap — a truly flexible, accessible, and **Tailwind-ready** color picker with developer experience in mind.

Built on top of [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/), it blends seamlessly with modern design systems like [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/), [Shadcn/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/), or even a plain [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) setup. If you’re already using one of these libraries, you’ll feel right at home.

While **Reka UI** is a required peer dependency, it doesn’t lock you into a single ecosystem. You can integrate the component with any UI library or even use it standalone. **TailwindCSS** itself is optional — every part of the picker can be styled with your own CSS classes or design tokens.
