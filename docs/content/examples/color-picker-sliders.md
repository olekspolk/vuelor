# ColorPicker Sliders Edition

For granular control, the library provides individual slider components for each color channel. These primitives — such as `ColorPickerSliderRed`, `ColorPickerSliderGreen`, `ColorPickerSliderBlue`, and `ColorPickerSliderAlpha` — can be combined to build completely custom interfaces.

## ColorPicker HSL Sliders

For applications that prioritize the HSL color model, you can utilize dedicated primitives to construct a complete HSL interface. By combining `ColorPickerSliderHue`, `ColorPickerSliderSaturation`, and `ColorPickerSliderLightness`, you provide users with intuitive control over color tone and intensity. This setup is ideal for design-focused tools where adjusting saturation or lightness independently is a key requirement.
